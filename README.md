## blockchain

The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008.

## history of blockchain-

bitcoin which only used to exchange money from one person to another.then introduce ethereum which is being used at a global level and created smart contracts from which you can do with blockchain. after that, hyperledger which is a permission or enterprise blockchain . we see similarities in bitcoin and in ethereum like security,transparency,immutability,and decentralized.so, except the feature transparency and goes to next framework hyperledger is a open source framework and manged by linux foundation and now it can applied to any systems .

## Types of networks-

# 1.Centralized

disadvantages - single point of failure

# 2.decentralized

advantages - multiple points of execution

## what is blockchain?

A decentralized computation and information sharing platform that enables multiple authoritative domains, who do not trust eachother, to co-operate,co-ordinate and collaborate in a rational decision making process.

## ledger

A ledger is a type of record keeping where financial transactions are recorded.A ledger database to secure data and enable an immutable ledger.

## feratures of blockchain-

1. decentralized(there is no single owner)
2. secure(provides very high level of security)
3. immutable(once written,cannot be changed)
4. global(no geographical boundaries)
5. privary and transparency(pseudo anonymous)
6. consensus based(everyone in the network agrees)

## cyptography--secure communication

cypto means secure and graphy means communication. 

There are different types of cyptography-

## 1.symmetric key cryptography

 In this encryption method, we take a single key into application. This common key is used for both the encryption as well as the decryption process. 

 disadvantages-  Using a common single key creates a problem of securely transferring the key between the sender and the receiver.

# cipher text-

describe the encrypted form of a message that was initially created as plaintext. The algorithm used to encrypt the message is known as cipher. 

## 2.asymmetric key cryptography

Asymmetric encryption is a form of cryptography that allows anyone to verify the integrity of their digital transactions and protect their funds.

note-public key used to encrpt the message and private or secret key used to decrypt  the message.

## hashing-

1Hashing in blockchain is a cryptographic process which takes an input (such as text) and turns it into an output of fixed length and structure known as the 'hash value'. It is always the same length and one-way, meaning it cannot be reversed.

## 51% attack-

A 51% attack is an attack on a blockchain network where a single entity gains control of more than half (51%) of its staking or computational power. 

## CBDC-

CBDC operates on a secure, transparent blockchain network, and it uses blockchain technology to create an immutable record of all transactions. This means that all transactions are recorded on a decentralized ledger, making it impossible to modify or tamper with the data.

## ICO-

An initial coin offering (ICO) is an event where a company sells a new cryptocurrency to raise money.

## IPO-

Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the way initial public offerings (IPOs) are conducted in the investment banking industry. 
the process of selling shares of a private company to the public for the first time, usually with the help of an intermediary such as an investment bank.

## root CA-

In cryptography and computer security, a root certificate is a public key certificate that identifies a root certificate authority (CA).Root certificates are self-signed (and it is possible for a certificate to have multiple trust paths, say if the certificate was issued by a root that was cross-signed) and form the basis of an X.509-based public key infrastructure (PKI).

## CSR(certificate signing request)-

A certificate signing request (CSR) is one of the first steps towards getting your own SSL/TLS certificate.

## encrypted tunnel-

With SD-WAN, each piece of data sent across branches is encrypted and travels through a secure tunnel.

## dsa(digital signing authority)-

DSA is a signature-only algorithm and requires a private key for signing and a public key for verifying. 

## sha-256 -

SHA-256 can help secure SSL/TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificates by creating a digital signature your device can verify. 

## IPF 's-

IPFS is a file sharing system that can be leveraged to more efficiently store and share large files. It relies on cryptographic hashes that can easily be stored on a blockchain.

## ERC-20 -

Ethereum Request for Comment 20 (ERC20) is a standard for the Ethereum blockchain that requires nine scripting functions and two events that must be used when creating a fungible token within a smart contract.

## matic polygon-

Polygon (formerly Matic Network) is a blockchain platform which aims to create a multi-chain blockchain system compatible with Ethereum. As with Ethereum, it uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism for processing transactions on-chain.
