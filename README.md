## blockchain

The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008.

## history of blockchain-

bitcoin which only used to exchange money from one person to another.then introduce ethereum which is being used at a global level and created smart contracts from which you can do with blockchain. after that, hyperledger which is a permission or enterprise blockchain . we see similarities in bitcoin and in ethereum like security,transparency,immutability,and decentralized.so, except the feature transparency and goes to next framework hyperledger is a open source framework and manged by linux foundation and now it can applied to any systems .

## Types of networks-

# 1.Centralized

disadvantages - single point of failure

# 2.decentralized

advantages - multiple points of execution ex: torrent that's why government is not abke to bsn because it is not central but a decentralized.

## what is blockchain?

A decentralized computation and information sharing platform that enables multiple authoritative domains, who do not trust eachother, to co-operate,co-ordinate and collaborate in a rational decision making process.

## ledger

A ledger is a type of record keeping where financial transactions are recorded.A ledger database to secure data and enable an immutable ledger.

## features of blockchain-

1. decentralized(there is no single owner)
2. secure(provides very high level of security)
3. immutable(once written,cannot be changed)
4. global(no geographical boundaries)
5. privary and transparency(pseudo anonymous)
6. consensus based(everyone in the network agrees)

## cyptography--secure communication

cypto means secure and graphy means communication. 

There are different types of cyptography-

## 1.symmetric key cryptography

 In this encryption method, we take a single key into application. This common key is used for both the encryption as well as the decryption process. 

 disadvantages-  Using a common single key creates a problem of securely transferring the key between the sender and the receiver.

# cipher text-

describe the encrypted form of a message that was initially created as plaintext. The algorithm used to encrypt the message is known as cipher. 

## 2.asymmetric key cryptography

Asymmetric encryption is a form of cryptography that allows anyone to verify the integrity of their digital transactions and protect their funds.

note-public key used to encrpt the message and private or secret key used to decrypt  the message.

## hashing(keyless cryptography)

1Hashing in blockchain is a cryptographic process which takes an input (such as text) and turns it into an output of fixed length and structure known as the 'hash value'. 

a)It is always the same length 
b)one-way, meaning it cannot be reversed
c)unique hash of each input
d) "avalanche effect", which means that a small change in the input results in a significant change in the output, making it statistically indistinguishable from random

-> algorithm in hash-
1.SHA 256-bitcoin(famous)
2. MD 150
3.Keccak 256

## 51% attack-

A 51% attack is an attack on a blockchain network where a single entity gains control of more than half (51%) of its staking or computational power. 

![Screenshot 2024-02-25 093619](https://github.com/Riyatomar14/blockchain/assets/143107173/38c0f16e-78dd-49d7-ad8c-063a144207e7)

confirmation mechanism: the receiver has to wait to 5-6 block ater transfer the bitcoin after that chance of attack decreases.

## FORKS-

Any change to the usual working of a blockchain results in a fork.

-> types-
## 1.temporary Fork

this type of fork is made in 51% attack and at the time when two miners validate the same bitcoin at the same time, then the miners which having the longest chain of blocks will wins and gets the rewards.

## 2.Soft Fork

## 3.Hard Fork

## halving

Halving is a process in which the reward given to miners or validators in a cryptocurrency network is reduced by half after a certain number of blocks are processed.

## double spending-

“Double-spending” means that the same units of a currency could be spent twice. Double-spending would destroy the trust in a cryptocurrency.

solution : Bitcoin uses a distributed ledger to publically record all transactions on the network. A distributed ledger allows anyone to view the entire history of each coin, and prove that no coin was spent twice.


## CBDC(Central Bank Digital Currency)-

CBDC operates on a secure, transparent blockchain network, and it uses blockchain technology to create an immutable record of all transactions. This means that all transactions are recorded on a decentralized ledger, making it impossible to modify or tamper with the data.

## ICO-

An initial coin offering (ICO) is an event where a company sells a new cryptocurrency to raise money.

## IPO-

Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the way initial public offerings (IPOs) are conducted in the investment banking industry. 
the process of selling shares of a private company to the public for the first time, usually with the help of an intermediary such as an investment bank.

## root CA-

In cryptography and computer security, a root certificate is a public key certificate that identifies a root certificate authority (CA).Root certificates are self-signed (and it is possible for a certificate to have multiple trust paths, say if the certificate was issued by a root that was cross-signed) and form the basis of an X.509-based public key infrastructure (PKI).

## CSR(certificate signing request)-

A certificate signing request (CSR) is one of the first steps towards getting your own SSL/TLS certificate.

## encrypted tunnel-

With SD-WAN, each piece of data sent across branches is encrypted and travels through a secure tunnel.

## dsa(digital signing authority)-

DSA is a signature-only algorithm and requires a private key for signing and a public key for verifying. 

## sha-256 -

SHA-256 can help secure SSL/TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificates by creating a digital signature your device can verify. 

## IPF 's-

IPFS is a file sharing system that can be leveraged to more efficiently store and share large files. It relies on cryptographic hashes that can easily be stored on a blockchain.

## ERC-20 -

Ethereum Request for Comment 20 (ERC20) is a standard for the Ethereum blockchain that requires nine scripting functions and two events that must be used when creating a fungible token within a smart contract.

## matic polygon-

Polygon (formerly Matic Network) is a blockchain platform which aims to create a multi-chain blockchain system compatible with Ethereum. As with Ethereum, it uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism for processing transactions on-chain.

## signatures-

## bitcoin architecture

![Screenshot 2024-02-24 020216](https://github.com/Riyatomar14/blockchain/assets/143107173/3cf9eab7-6f91-4e25-b1cc-c75d438a270c)

problem: anyone can submit transactions on anyone's behalf in the network?

-> by digital signature for authentication

problem: through directly entering the transaction into the ledger and having a mismatch in the sequence of transactions ?

-> every person in the network have a transaction pool(also called memory pool is a temporary storage before entering the data into the ledger) when, transaction request is send then first it validate otherwise sits in transaction pool and then added to the ledger.In this way, no wrong sequence can enter the ledger.

problem: cannot deal with mutiple blocks at the same time?

->miners as volunteers will create and validate the bolck ,whoever finds the block first wins

problem: why they want to volunteer?

-> give them a montetary rewards

problem: miners can hack and tamper(he think as he does not have anything to lose) transaction while validating?

-> give them penalty-ask them to do some works so that they have something to lose if they provide if they provide an invalid block.
