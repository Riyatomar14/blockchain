## blockchain

The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008.

## Types of networks-

# 1.Centralized

disadvantages - single point of failure

# 2.decentralized

advantages - multiple points of execution

## what is blockchain?

A decentralized computation and information sharing platform that enables multiple authoritative domains, who do not trust eachother, to co-operate,co-ordinate and collaborate in a rational decision making process.

## ledger

A ledger is a type of record keeping where financial transactions are recorded.A ledger database to secure data and enable an immutable ledger.

## feratures of blockchain-

1. decentralized(there is no single owner)
2. secure(provides very high level of security)
3. immutable(once written,cannot be changed)
4. global(no geographical boundaries)
5. privary and transparency(pseudo anonymous)
6. consensus based(everyone in the network agrees)

## cyptography--secure communication

cypto means secure and graphy means communication. 

There are different types of cyptography-

## 1.symmetric key cryptography

 In this encryption method, we take a single key into application. This common key is used for both the encryption as well as the decryption process. 

 disadvantages-  Using a common single key creates a problem of securely transferring the key between the sender and the receiver.

# cipher text-

describe the encrypted form of a message that was initially created as plaintext. The algorithm used to encrypt the message is known as cipher. 

## 2.asymmetric key cryptography

Asymmetric encryption is a form of cryptography that allows anyone to verify the integrity of their digital transactions and protect their funds.

note-public key used to encrpt the message and private or secret key used to decrypt  the message.

## hashing-

1Hashing in blockchain is a cryptographic process which takes an input (such as text) and turns it into an output of fixed length and structure known as the 'hash value'. It is always the same length and one-way, meaning it cannot be reversed.

## 51% attack-A 51% attack is an attack on a blockchain network where a single entity gains control of more than half (51%) of its staking or computational power. 

## CBDC-

## ICO-

## IPO-

## root CA-

## CSR(certificate signong request)-

## encrypted tunnel-

## dsa(digital signing authority)-

## sha-256 -

## IPF 's-

## ERC-20 -

## matic polygon-
